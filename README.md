This repository hosts an implementation of a visual odometry (VO) pipeline that takes inspiration from the sophisticated methodologies employed in COLMAP. The pipeline leverages an adjugate quaternion formulation for Perspective-n-Point (PnP) and incorporates advanced optimization methods to achieve accurate pose estimation.
